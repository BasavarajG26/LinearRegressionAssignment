# LinearRegressionAssignment
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 
# Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

# Business Objective
* To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantinesituation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

* To understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

* The company wants to know:
  <br> a. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. <br> 
  b. How well those variables describe the bike demands.

* To model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to 
  understand how exactly the demands vary with different features
